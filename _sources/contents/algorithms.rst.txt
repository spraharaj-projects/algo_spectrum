Algorithms
==========

In the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), algorithms serve as the
backbone of efficient data manipulation and problem-solving. Algorithms in DSA
encompass a diverse array of techniques, ranging from simple linear search and
bubble sort to complex graph traversal and dynamic programming. These algorithms
are meticulously designed to address various computational challenges,
optimizing resource utilization and enabling streamlined data processing. By
mastering algorithms in DSA, learners gain invaluable problem-solving skills and
the ability to tackle a wide range of real-world problems with precision and
efficiency. With a strong foundation in algorithms, DSA practitioners can
navigate intricate data structures, devise optimal solutions, and propel
innovation in fields spanning from software engineering to machine learning.
