=============

The Algo Spectrum DSA Project is a comprehensive repository of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. It aims to provide a versatile toolkit for developers, educators, and enthusiasts interested in mastering fundamental concepts of computer science.

The project is organized into two main packages: algorithms and data_structures.

- The **algorithms** package includes a wide range of efficient algorithms for searching, sorting, graph traversal, and more. Each algorithm is meticulously designed and implemented to provide optimal solutions for various computational problems.
- The **data_structures** package contains essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. These data structures are the building blocks of many algorithms and are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently.

By offering a rich collection of algorithms and data structures, the Algo
Spectrum DSA Project aims to empower developers with the tools they need to
tackle real-world problems, enhance their problem-solving skills, and deepen
their understanding of core computer science concepts.
